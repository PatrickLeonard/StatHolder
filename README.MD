## Synopsis

A roster and statistical profile storage system, think sports, that had some basic search capabilities and required user input. The major design considerations were how to make this program contain a binary search tree where each node was also a linked list, and maintaining the spirit of object oriented programming through the concept of inheritance. 

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about C++ and it was also the subject of a college class for using C++ and Java to teach object oriented programming concepts. This program was for a second-year course in computer programming and object oriented programmming. 

## Installation

Compile using your favorite C++ compiler and execute the program on the command line, or you can try the makefile that is included and then execute the program.
